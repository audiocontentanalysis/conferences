## MIR Deadlines 

Countdown timers to keep track of conference deadlines related to ML/DSP for music. This has been [happily forked](https://github.com/paperswithcode/ai-deadlines).

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

To keep things minimal, I'm only looking to list conferences that allow publications on music and related topics.

To add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline
- Optionally add `hindex` (refers to h5-index from [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng))
- Example:
    ```yaml
    - title: BestConf
      year: 2022
      id: bestconf22  # title as lower case + last two digits of year
      full_name: Best Conference for Anything  # full conference name
      link: link-to-website.com
      deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS
      abstract_deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS
      timezone: Asia/Seoul
      place: Incheon, South Korea
      date: September, 18-22, 2022
      start: YYYY-MM-DD
      end: YYYY-MM-DD
